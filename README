# Websocket server for JS impress remote protocol

# Installation

This isn't meant to be run as a standalone project right now, instead it's run by [libresign](https://github.com/LibreOffice/libresign), but it can be installed thusly

```
pip install irpjs
```

and it will also be installed as a dependency when you install libresign

```
pip install libresign
```

# Development

This is a simple one-file program. It simply starts a websocket server andreroutes requests sent from a client (using the [irpjs-client](https://github.com/rptr/irpjs-client) library) to a LibreOffice instance running on the same machine.

`apt-get install python3 pip3`
